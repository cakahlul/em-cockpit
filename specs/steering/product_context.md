# Product Context

## Product Vision
The **EM Cockpit** is a "Command Center" for Engineering Managers (EMs). It solves the problem of tool fragmentation by providing a unified, native desktop interface to manage the disparate systems EMs interact with daily: Jira tickets, Pull Requests, Incident alerts, and Technical Specifications.

Instead of keeping 50 browser tabs open, an EM can use a global hotkey (`Alt+Space`) to instantly access the state of their team, review code, or triage an incident.

## Core Value Props
1.  **Unified Control**: One interface for Jira, GitHub, PagerDuty, and Confluence.
2.  **Speed**: Native performance, keyboard-driven workflows, and optimistic UI.
3.  **Focus**: "Spotlight-style" interaction model reduces context switching.
4.  **Privacy**: Local-first architecture; credentials stay on the device.

## Key Workflows
-   **Flight Console**: A spotlight search bar acts as the entry point. Users can search for "PRs", "Incidents", or specific ticket IDs.
-   **PR Radar**: A dashboard view that visualizes PR velocity, highlights stale reviews, and surfaces "needs attention" items.
-   **Incident Bridge**: Real-time polling of incident monitoring systems with system tray alerts for critical issues.
-   **Spec Scanner**: (Future) AI-powered analysis of PRDs and technical specs.

## Target Audience
-   Engineering Managers
-   Tech Leads
-   Senior Engineers who manage multiple streams of work.
